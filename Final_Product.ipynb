    "According to the Michigan Bureau of Labor Market Information's Occupational Employment Statistics report for 2018 - Sales, Advertising and Marketing positions account for 1,176,030 jobs within the state. Due to the current statewide shelter in place order, many of these positions are stagnant and not performing. In order to help these positions focus thier efforts once the statewide shelter in place order is lifted, I plan to cluster neighborhood data within Michigan by population and yearly GDP. \n",
